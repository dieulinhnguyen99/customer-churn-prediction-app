# customer-churn-prediction-app
Churn rate is a critical metric of customer satisfaction. Low churn rates mean happy customers, high churn rates mean customers are leaving the company.

It takes a lot more money (up to five times more) to get new customers than to keep the ones you already have. Churn tells you how many existing customers are leaving your business, so lowering churn has a big positive impact on your revenue streams.

Churn is a good indicator of growth potential. Churn rates track lost customers, and growth rates track new customersâ€”comparing and analyzing both of these metrics tells you exactly how much your business is growing over time. If growth is higher than churn, you can say your business is growing. If churn is higher than growth, your business is getting smaller. 


In this project I explored the churn rate in-depth and did implementation of a machine learning churn rate prediction system. To achieve that, I implemented the entire pipeline from 
- preprosseing 
- training
- evaluation
- visualization

and set up a dashboard with streamlit.
